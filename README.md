# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Our task for this week was to help out at Pewlett Hackard in figuring out how many employees will be retiring soon, how many will be able to mentor before they leave, and how that will affect the newer employees who *do* need to be trained/mentored. The __*Silver Tsunami*__ is coming.
